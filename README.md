# Metro

Welcome to Metro.

At Salesforce, we have a number of document platforms. Like most
companies, our needs for all our tooling, including docs, have evolved
with our growth. For internal working info, we deploy content  several
ways: using GitHub Pages, Google Sites, Google Docs, Confluence, Quip, and
who knows what else. Our engineering teams like the flexibility to write
using their platform of choice. We like the idea of people writing and
don't want to block that impulse.

Of course, not everything that's written inside is appropriate for a
Saleforce-wide audience. For those topics that are, wouldn't it be great
to have a tool that would migrate content to our enterprise content
platform (Atlassian Confluence)? Of course it would! That's why we have **Metro**.

Metro is a tool originally written by a Salesforce employee to make it easy for anyone to
push docs from their working platform into Confluence. Written in
Python, it's easy to set up and simple to use. Take a look at the [metro docs on ReadTheDocs](https://metro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information.
