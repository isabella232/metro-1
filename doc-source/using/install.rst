This section describes how to set up metro. It's pretty simple:

1. Clone the `metro source<https://github.com/salesforce/metro>` from GitHub. 
2. Follow the instructions for your source content of choice (google docs, quip, etc) to identify the docs you want to port. For Google docs, you will need to set up a Google Script project. See `Converting a Google Doc<https://metro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/convert-google-doc.html>` for more information.

That's it. When you are ready to do an import, just run the *import_pages* file.
